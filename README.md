# Geometrae

A geometry website I made with a schoolmate in 2011, a bit like [GeoGabra](https://www.geogebra.org). The euclidean plane itself is written using coffeescript and runs client side, the original project also contained a exercise / course system written in php. 

## Demo

A sandbox of the geometry engine is available at http://geometrae.mathijshenquet.nl/

## Running

The php server can be run with modern php installs using eg `php -d error_reporting="E_ERROR | E_WARNING | E_PARSE" -S localhost:8000 router.php`
